# wordle-wizard

A fun side project born out of the question: "Can you hack Wordle ?". Wordle is a web based game, which gives a user 6 guesses to guess the 5 letter word of the day, play it [here](https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html).

Whilst this is not a hack, it does help solve Wordle puzzles, by generating possible answers given the current board state as input. 

## Building and running 
The code can be can be compiled from source. 

1. Assuming Go is installed navigate to the project folder and run `go build`
2. The executable can then be call using `.\wordleWizard.exe`

## Usage

The Wordle board state is the input. This is translated to the following command line arguments  
**-e** characters excluded (dark grey blocks), these can be entered as a sequence with no seperator e.g: abcd  
**-i** characters included but whose position is unknown (yellow blocks), these can be entered as a sequence with no seperator e.g: abcd  
**-p** characters included whose positions are known (green blocks), these can be entered as a sequence consisting of the characters followed by their index e.g: a0d3  

## Example
Using STEAK as a starting point, the Wordle board now looks like:

From the result, it is seen that 's' is in position 0 and the word of the day does not contain 't', 'e', 'a' or 'k', this can be translated to the command: `.\wordleWizard.exe -p s0 -e teak` which outputs:

One of the retrieved words could then be used as a next guess. Assuming SHOWN is used as the next input, this leaves the state of the board as follows:

From the last guess, the correct position of 'o' is revealed as index 2, additionally it is known that 'h', 'w' and 'n' are also excluded, this can be used to craft a more precise command: `.\wordleWizard.exe -p s0o2 -e teakhwn` which outputs:

As more info is added, the number of possibilities reduce. 

Using SPOIL as the next guess, results in the following board:

Incorporating the new info of 2 more exclusions 'p' and 'i' as well as an inclusion 'l' whose position is not known, an updated query can be run: `.\wordleWizard.exe -p s0o2 -e teakhwnpi -i l`

In this case, the guessed word works, splendid!

## Possible improvements
1. Use a PCRE regex engine for more concise cleaner code. Currently, Go's standard library RE2 engine is used, which does not supports lookaheads which could simplify the code.  
2. Improve parsing, currently the parsing of positioned characters wont work for indices greater than 9
